/// Authentication, on Supabase Auth (GoTrue).
///
/// ── What GoTrue took over
///
/// Token rotation, reuse detection, expiry, and refresh-on-401 are all gone from
/// this codebase. `supabase_flutter` refreshes in the background and re-attaches
/// the bearer to every PostgREST call, which is why `ApiClient`'s two interceptors
/// and `SessionManager`'s in-flight-refresh de-duplication no longer exist.
///
/// ── What GoTrue does NOT do
///
/// Roles and approval. GoTrue authenticates; it has no opinion about whether this
/// association has let the person in. That lives in `public.profiles`, is read
/// through `api_me()`, and is enforced by RLS on every table — so a signed-in but
/// unapproved user holds a perfectly valid JWT and can still see nothing.
///
/// ── What was LOST
///
/// The old schema stored refresh tokens with a `replaced_by` chain, which is how a
/// stolen token was told apart from an ordinary rotation and how a logout was told
/// apart from a theft. GoTrue rotates and detects reuse, but does not expose that
/// chain, so the association keeps theft DETECTION and loses theft INVESTIGATION.
/// Recorded as residual risk R4 in docs/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md.
