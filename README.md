# جمعية العائلة — Family Association Subscription & Treasury

A Flutter app on Supabase for a Libyan family association: member directory,
monthly subscription receivables, payment collection with FIFO allocation, a
treasury ledger, and an append-only audit trail. Arabic, right-to-left.

It began as `index.html` — a single-file React prototype using `localStorage`.
That file is still in the repository, unmodified, because it remains the
behavioural reference: the twelve business rules were transcribed from it and are
verified against it.

---

## The one thing to understand first

**There is no server.** The app talks to Supabase directly, and the anon key ships
inside the APK and in plain text in the web bundle. It is not a secret and cannot
be made one — anyone who installs the app can extract it and issue their own
PostgREST calls from curl.

So every business rule, every role check and every money invariant is enforced
**inside PostgreSQL** — by RLS policies, CHECK constraints, triggers, generated
columns, and `SECURITY DEFINER` functions. Validation in Dart is a convenience for
the user and counts for nothing.

That single constraint explains most of the design:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Reads** | Direct PostgREST against `v_*` views, gated by RLS on the caller's role |
| **Writes** | Only through eleven `SECURITY DEFINER` functions. `authenticated` holds no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on any table, and no table has a write policy |
| **Why** | A policy can only judge the row in front of it. It cannot know that this insert into `payment_allocations` is the third of five that must all land or none. A function body is one transaction |

**Money is text end to end.** Postgres serialises `numeric` as a bare JSON number,
and `dart:convert` decodes that to `double`. Every amount is cast to text in SQL,
and `app/tool/supabase_lint.dart` fails the build if Dart ever reads a base table
directly, because that path returns floats.

---

## Running it

```bash
# Android emulator, against Supabase
run_emulator.bat                 # or: run_emulator.bat --list | --release

# Web
cd app && bash run_supabase.sh
```

Both scripts carry the project URL and anon key. Google sign-in needs the provider
enabled in the Supabase dashboard; until then use the dev sign-in button, which is
an ordinary email/password account with **no** special privilege — its role still
comes from `public.profiles` like everyone else's.

Google sign-in: `docs/GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md` walks through it end to end. The short
version is that the app uses `signInWithIdToken`, so you need an Android OAuth
client (package name + signing SHA-1) *and* a web one, and the **web** client ID
is the one the app is built with.

New installs: see `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`. It covers applying the schema
(`supabase/APPLY_TO_SUPABASE.sql`, one transaction, self-verifying), enabling
Google, and getting the first administrator in — which needs a deliberate manual
step, because every profile is created `viewer`/`pending` and the first person has
nobody to approve them.

## Verification

Nothing here is asserted without an executable check.

```bash
bash supabase/tests/local_pg.sh start      # provisions a local PostgreSQL
bash supabase/tests/probe.sh               # 257 checks
python supabase/tests/verify_live.py <pw>  # over HTTPS; SEE THE WARNING BELOW
cd app && flutter test                     # 121 tests
cd app && dart run tool/rtl_lint.dart
cd app && dart run tool/supabase_lint.dart
cd app && flutter analyze
```

**`probe.sh`** runs every one of the twelve business rules against a real
PostgreSQL with a passing case *and a failing case*. The failing case is the only
one that proves anything — a probe that inserts a valid row shows the column
exists, not that the rule bites. It also races two real psql sessions against one
balance to prove the FIFO allocation cannot double-spend, and injects a failure
after the allocations are written to prove the whole transaction rolls back.

**`verify_live.py`** seeds its own starting state, which means it **erases every
payment, receivable, cash movement and audit entry in the project it points at**.
It refuses once the project holds more than the one fixture family unless you
pass `--reset`. Never point it at a project with real figures in it. It is the
layer the local suite cannot reach: PostgREST's status
codes, GoTrue's JWT, and the actual JSON encoding. A privilege-escalation bug
(`write_audit` callable by any signed-in user) passed every local check and was
caught only here — see §8.4 of `docs/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.

**`app/test/supabase_contract_test.dart`** parses real wire JSON captured from
PostgreSQL by `supabase/tests/extract_fixtures.sh`. Rename a view column and the
models stop parsing there, before anyone runs the app.

Both layers are needed. The local suite proves the SQL; only the live run proves
the platform.

## Layout

```
index.html                     the original prototype — the parity oracle
app/                           the Flutter app
  lib/core/supabase/           client, secure session storage, error mapping
  lib/core/config/             theme + the glass/flat design system
  lib/features/*/data/         four repositories: views for reads, RPC for writes
  tool/rtl_lint.dart           no physical left/right; no Arabic outside l10n
  tool/supabase_lint.dart      no base-table reads; no PostgREST writes
supabase/
  migrations/                  the schema, in order
  APPLY_TO_SUPABASE.sql        all of it in one transaction, for a fresh project
  bootstrap_first_admin.sql    the first administrator, by hand, on purpose
  tests/                       probe suite, fixtures, live verification
docs/
  SUPABASE_SETUP.md            how to stand up a project
  GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md             enabling Google sign-in, and why it fails
  SUPABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md   what each piece became, and what was lost
  MIGRATION_PLAN.md            the original Node/MySQL plan, for history
```

The retired Node/Express + MySQL tier is **not** in this repository. Nothing in the
app points at it — reads go to PostgREST views, writes to RPC, auth to GoTrue — and
it is kept locally only until the MariaDB data is migrated.

## Security notes for anyone reading this repository

Deliberately committed, and worth knowing:

- **`run_emulator.bat` and `app/run_supabase.sh` contain the Supabase URL and anon
  key.** Public by design; see the top of this file.
- **`run_emulator.bat` also contains the dev-login password**, and that account is
  an approved **admin** on the live project. **This repository is public, so treat
  that password as compromised and rotate it** — Supabase dashboard →
  Authentication → Users. It is in git history; deleting the line is not enough.
- The **`service_role` key and the database password are NOT in this repository**,
  and must never be. `service_role` bypasses RLS entirely.

Outstanding, tracked in `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` §7: backups (the Supabase free
tier has none at all), and per-user rate limiting on the RPCs.
